## **Car Sales Data Visualization**

### **Overview**

This project involves visualizing the distribution of car sales data, focusing on various aspects such as car prices, annual incomes of customers, genders, car models, transmission types, and other relevant variables. The visualization is done using histograms and bar charts to gain insights into the dataset.

### **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the "car_sales_data.csv" file, containing information about individual car sales transactions. The dataset includes the following columns:

- Car_id: Unique identifier for each car sale transaction.

- Phone: Phone number of the dealer.
- Dealer_Region: Region where the dealer is located.
